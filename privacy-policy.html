    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 2024-05-22</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to reTAPe BPM ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, reTAPe BPM ("App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do not collect personal information that can directly identify you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect non-personal information about your use of the App. This includes, but is not limited to, device type, operating system, app version, and usage data such as session duration and frequency. This data is collected for analytical purposes only and is anonymized or aggregated, ensuring that no personally identifiable information is collected or processed.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics: To understand how users interact with the App, monitor usage trends, and identify areas for improvement.</li>
        <li>App Improvement: To enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the App based on collected data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect or process any data for advertising or marketing purposes, and the data we collect is not used to track users across different apps or websites.</p>

    <h2>3. No App Tracking Transparency Requirement</h2>
    <p>Since the data we collect is anonymized and used solely for internal analytics and app improvement, and we do not track users across other apps or websites, our app does not require the implementation of Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>
    <p>We do not link the data collected in the App with other third-party data for advertising or marketing purposes. Therefore, we do not request users' permission to track, as no tracking of user activity occurs.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute your personal information to third parties. Non-personal data may be shared with third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics solely to help us understand user behavior within the App and improve the App based on this data.</p>
    <p>We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses and prevent any personal or identifiable information from being collected. Furthermore, we do not use Google Analytics or any other tools for tracking users across different applications or websites.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App uses Google Analytics to assist with understanding how users interact with the App. This service collects non-personal, anonymized data such as device type, operating system, and usage patterns. Google Analytics is configured to anonymize all data, and no personally identifiable information is collected. We do not use any advertising features or tracking services within Google Analytics.</p>
    <p>For more information on how Google Analytics handles data, please review their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and use. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted in the App.</p>
