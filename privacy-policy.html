    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 2024-09-11</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to reTAPe BPM ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, reTAPe BPM ("App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do not collect personal information that can directly identify you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect non-personal information about your use of the App. This includes, but is not limited to, device type, operating system, app version, and usage data such as session duration and frequency. This data is collected for analytical purposes only and is anonymized or aggregated, ensuring that no personally identifiable information is collected or processed.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics: To understand how users interact with the App, monitor usage trends, and identify areas for improvement.</li>
        <li>App Improvement: To enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the App based on collected data.</li>
        <li>Advertising: To display ads via third-party services such as AdMob. Advertising data may be collected to personalize ads shown within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and Advertising</h2>
    <p>Our app may display ads using third-party services such as AdMob. To ensure transparency and protect your privacy, we will request your permission to track your activity across apps and websites through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>
    <p>If you grant permission, we may collect information such as device identifiers (e.g., IDFA) and usage data to deliver personalized ads. If you do not grant permission, non-personalized ads may still be shown, but no tracking data will be collected.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute your personal information to third parties. Non-personal data may be shared with third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics and advertising networks such as AdMob solely to help us understand user behavior within the App and serve relevant advertisements.</p>
    <p>We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses and prevent any personal or identifiable information from being collected. Furthermore, we do not use Google Analytics or any other tools for tracking users across different applications or websites unless permission has been granted via ATT.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App uses third-party services such as Google Analytics for analytics and AdMob for displaying ads. These services may collect non-personal, anonymized data such as device type, operating system, and usage patterns. Google Analytics is configured to anonymize all data, and no personally identifiable information is collected without user permission. We use AdMob to display ads, and if you consent to tracking, data may be collected to show personalized ads.</p>
    <p>For more information on how Google Analytics and AdMob handle data, please review their respective <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy policies</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and use. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Subscription and Purchase Options</h2>
    <p>We offer various purchase options for the app, including subscriptions and one-time purchases. Specific details about these options, such as pricing, duration, and promotions, may vary and are displayed at the time of purchase.</p>
    <p>Payment and billing are handled through Apple. Subscription details, including the length of the subscription, auto-renewal status, and pricing, are clearly outlined on the purchase screen before you complete your transaction.</p>
    <p>We may update or change the available purchase options from time to time, such as replacing one-time purchases with subscriptions or offering promotional pricing. Any changes to pricing or subscription terms will be communicated to you through the app or during the purchase process.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
